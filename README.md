# Java Beginner Projects 💻

## Overview  
This repository contains a collection of small Java console programs — exercises, games and sample applications — created to help practice and learn fundamental Java programming constructs (arrays, loops, conditionals, user input, basic logic, etc.).  
Each `.java` file typically represents one self-contained “mini-project” or exercise.  

Use this repo as a personal practice set, a reference for basic Java techniques, or a starting point to build more complex programs.

## Projects / Contents  
Here are some of the included programs:  

| Filename | Description / Purpose |
|---------|-----------------------|
| `array.java`, `array_2d.java`, `array_input.java`, `array_search.java` | Examples of working with arrays (1D and 2D), array input and simple search logic |
| `banking_program.java` | Simple simulation of banking operations (depending on implementation) |
| `calculator_project.java` | Basic calculator functionality (arithmetic operations) |
| `compound_intest_calculation.java` | Calculates compound interest (educational finance/math example) |
| `dice_roller_programme.java` | Simulates dice rolling (randomness, user interaction) |
| `java_quizz_game.java` | Quiz-like program (user input, conditionals, flow control) |
| `rock_paper_scissor.java` | Rock–Paper–Scissors game (randomness, user interaction) |
| `slot_machine.java` | Slot-machine style game (random outcome generation, game logic) |
| `varagrs.java` | Demonstrates use of variable arguments (`varargs`) in Java methods |
| `weight_converted_program.java` | Simple unit conversion program (weight conversion) |
| ...and possibly others as you continue adding new exercises. | |

> ⚠️ Note: this is not a polished, production-ready “application.” These are learning / exercise projects meant to help practice basic Java syntax and fundamental programming logic.

## Prerequisites  
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (Java 8 or newer recommended)  
- A console / terminal (or IDE with console support) capable of compiling and running Java programs  

## How to Compile & Run a Program  

1. Clone or download the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hanzecode/Java-beginner-projects.git
